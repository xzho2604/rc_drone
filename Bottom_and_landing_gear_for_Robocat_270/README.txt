# Summary

I decided to assemble the frame Robocat 270 not as intended. I used the flight controller Omnibus F4 v3 pro (without current sensor) and PDB/ESC board BS430. But the simultaneous installation of these boards on the frame Robocat 270 is not provided. I installed the PDB board in the designated place and the flight controller I installed on the back side at the bottom (see photo). To protect the flight controller I made a model of bottom case. At the same time I decided to fix the landing gears on it. To fix the bottom case, you must move the four threaded pillars to the opposite side. This kind of assembly at the same time facilitates the dismantling of the frame for access to the boards separately. Through the holes at the bottom of the landing gear it is possible to pass carbon tubes with OD 3 mm. Together with the flight controller I also plan to place a compass board and RC receiver Radiolink R12DSM.
